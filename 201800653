/* Program Design:
1. Construct a POKEMON CLASS
2. Make 5 Pokemon Objects
3. Put them into an ARRAY: The array elements are your POKEBALLs
4. Use Random numbers to pull out 2 Pokemon
5. Battles are done with Methods and Random Number Generators for Attack Strengths
6. Use https://paiza.io/ to smith your Code.

// Part One: #todo: Write code to perform 10 Battles
// for each battle, randomly pull 2 Pokemon out of the Pokeball
// let them each do their Attack
// Strongest Attack Wins!
// Output the contestants and the Winners!!!
// POKEMON: I CHOOSE YOU!

// Part Two: #todo: Give your Pokemon Names and Types: Create an array of Names
// use rand to select a Name for each Pokemon
// make sure to remove that name from the array so it is not issued Twice!!!  

// Part Three: #todo: Create a POKEDEX to store the results of BATTLES
